IXWebSocket is a C++ library for client and server Websocket communication, and for client and server HTTP communication. TLS aka SSL is supported. The code is derived from easywsclient and from the Satori C SDK . It has been tested on the following platforms. macOS iOS Linux Android Windows FreeBSD Example code // Required on Windows ix::initNetSystem(); // Our websocket object ix::WebSocket webSocket; std::string url(\"ws://localhost:8080/\"); webSocket.setUrl(url); // Setup a callback to be fired when a message or an event (open, close, error) is received webSocket.setOnMessageCallback([](const ix::WebSocketMessagePtr& msg) { if (msg->type == ix::WebSocketMessageType::Message) { std::cout << msg->str << std::endl; } } ); // Now that our callback is setup, we can start our background thread and receive messages webSocket.start(); // Send a message to the server (default to TEXT mode) webSocket.send(\"hello world\"); Why another library? There are 2 main reasons that explain why IXWebSocket got written. First, we needed a C++ cross-platform client library, which should have few dependencies. What looked like the most solid one, websocketpp did depend on boost and this was not an option for us. Secondly, there were other available libraries with fewer dependencies (C ones), but they required calling an explicit poll routine periodically to know if a client had received data from a server, which was not elegant. We started by solving those 2 problems, then we added server websocket code, then an HTTP client, and finally a very simple HTTP server. IXWebSocket comes with a command line utility named ws which is quite handy, and is now packaged with alpine linux. You can install it with apk add ws . Few dependencies (only zlib) Simple to use ; uses std::string and std::function callbacks. Complete support of the websocket protocol, and basic http support. Client and Server TLS support Alternative libraries There are plenty of great websocket libraries out there, which might work for you. Here are a couple of serious ones. websocketpp - C++ beast - C++ libwebsockets - C \u00b5WebSockets - C Contributing IXWebSocket is developed on GitHub . We'd love to hear about how you use it; opening up an issue on GitHub is ok for that.

The per message deflate compression option is supported. It can lead to very nice bandbwith savings (20x !) if your messages are similar, which is often the case for example for chat applications. All features of the spec should be supported. TLS/SSL Connections can be optionally secured and encrypted with TLS/SSL when using a wss:// endpoint, or using normal un-encrypted socket with ws:// endpoints. AppleSSL is used on iOS and macOS, OpenSSL and mbedTLS can be used on Android, Linux and Windows. If you are using OpenSSL, try to be on a version higher than 1.1.x as there there are thread safety problems with 1.0.x. Polling and background thread work No manual polling to fetch data is required. Data is sent and received instantly by using a background thread for receiving data and the select system call to be notified by the OS of incoming data. No timeout is used for select so that the background thread is only woken up when data is available, to optimize battery life. This is also the recommended way of using select according to the select tutorial, section select law . Read and Writes to the socket are non blocking. Data is sent right away and not enqueued by writing directly to the socket, which is possible since system socket implementations allow concurrent read/writes. However concurrent writes need to be protected with mutex. Automatic reconnection If the remote end (server) breaks the connection, the code will try to perpetually reconnect, by using an exponential backoff strategy, capped at one retry every 10 seconds. This behavior can be disabled. Large messages Large frames are broken up into smaller chunks or messages to avoid filling up the os tcp buffers, which is permitted thanks to WebSocket fragmentation . Messages up to 1G were sent and received succesfully. Testing The library has an interactive tool which is handy for testing compatibility ith other libraries. We have tested our client against Python, Erlang, Node.js, and C++ websocket server libraries. The unittest tries to be comprehensive, and has been running on multiple platforms, with different sanitizers such as a thread sanitizer to catch data races or the undefined behavior sanitizer. The regression test is running after each commit on github actions for multiple configurations. Linux macOS with thread sanitizer macOS, with OpenSSL, with thread sanitizer macOS, with MbedTLS, with thread sanitizer Windows, with MbedTLS (the unittest is not run yet) Limitations On some configuration (mostly Android) certificate validation needs to be setup so that SocketTLSOptions.caFile point to a pem file, such as the one distributed by Firefox. Unless that setup is done connecting to a wss endpoint will display an error. With mbedtls the message will contain error in handshake : X509 - Certificate verification failed, e.g. CRL, CA or signature check failed . Automatic reconnection works at the TCP socket level, and will detect remote end disconnects. However, if the device/computer network become unreachable (by turning off wifi), it is quite hard to reliably and timely detect it at the socket level using recv and send error codes. Here is a good discussion on the subject. This behavior is consistent with other runtimes such as node.js. One way to detect a disconnected device with low level C code is to do a name resolution with DNS but this can be expensive. Mobile devices have good and reliable API to do that. The server code is using select to detect incoming data, and creates one OS thread per connection. This is not as scalable as strategies using epoll or kqueue.

The payloadSize field and wireSize fields will tell you respectively how much bytes the message weight, and how many bytes were sent on the wire (potentially compressed + counting the message header (a few bytes). There is an optional progress callback that can be passed in as the second argument. If a message is large it will be fragmented into chunks which will be sent independantly. Everytime the we can write a fragment into the OS network cache, the callback will be invoked. If a user wants to cancel a slow send, false should be returned from within the callback. Here is an example code snippet copied from the ws send sub-command. Each fragment weights 32K, so the total integer is the wireSize divided by 32K. As an example if you are sending 32M of data, uncompressed, total will be 1000. current will be set to 0 for the first fragment, then 1, 2 etc... auto result = _webSocket.sendBinary(serializedMsg, [this, throttle](int current, int total) -> bool { spdlog::info(\"ws_send: Step {} out of {}\", current + 1, total); if (throttle) { std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli> duration(10); std::this_thread::sleep_for(duration); } return _connected; }); ReadyState getReadyState() returns the state of the connection. There are 4 possible states. ReadyState::Connecting - The connection is not yet open. ReadyState::Open - The connection is open and ready to communicate. ReadyState::Closing - The connection is in the process of closing. ReadyState::Closed - The connection is closed or could not be opened. Open and Close notifications The onMessage event will be fired when the connection is opened or closed. This is similar to the JavaScript browser API , which has open and close events notification that can be registered with the browser addEventListener . webSocket.setOnMessageCallback([](const ix::WebSocketMessagePtr& msg) { if (msg->type == ix::WebSocketMessageType::Open) { std::cout << \"send greetings\" << std::endl; // Headers can be inspected (pairs of string/string) std::cout << \"Handshake Headers:\" << std::endl; for (auto it : msg->headers) { std::cout << it.first << \": \" << it.second << std::endl; } } else if (msg->type == ix::WebSocketMessageType::Close) { std::cout << \"disconnected\" << std::endl; // The server can send an explicit code and reason for closing. // This data can be accessed through the closeInfo object. std::cout << msg->closeInfo.code << std::endl; std::cout << msg->closeInfo.reason << std::endl; } } ); Error notification A message will be fired when there is an error with the connection. The message type will be ix::WebSocketMessageType::Error . Multiple fields will be available on the event to describe the error. webSocket.setOnMessageCallback([](const ix::WebSocketMessagePtr& msg) { if (msg->type == ix::WebSocketMessageType::Error) { std::stringstream ss; ss << \"Error: \" << msg->errorInfo.reason << std::endl; ss << \"#retries: \" << msg->eventInfo.retries << std::endl; ss << \"Wait time(ms): \" << msg->eventInfo.wait_time << std::endl; ss << \"HTTP Status: \" << msg->eventInfo.http_status << std::endl; std::cout << ss.str() << std::endl; } } ); start, stop websocket.start() connect to the remote server and starts the message receiving background thread. websocket.stop() disconnect from the remote server and closes the background thread. Configuring the remote url The url can be set and queried after a websocket object has been created. You will have to call stop and start if you want to disconnect and connect to that new url. std::string url(\"wss://example.com\"); websocket.configure(url); Ping/Pong support Ping/pong messages are used to implement keep-alive. 2 message types exists to identify ping and pong messages. Note that when a ping message is received, a pong is instantly send back as requested by the WebSocket spec. webSocket.setOnMessageCallback([](const ix::WebSocketMessagePtr& msg) { if (msg->type == ix::WebSocketMessageType::Ping || msg->type == ix::WebSocketMessageType::Pong) { std::cout << \"pong data: \" << msg->str << std::endl; } } ); A ping message can be sent to the server, with an optional data string. websocket.ping(\"ping data, optional (empty string is ok): limited to 125 bytes long\"); Heartbeat. You can configure an optional heart beat / keep-alive, sent every 45 seconds when there is no any traffic to make sure that load balancers do not kill an idle connection. webSocket.setPingInterval(45); Supply extra HTTP headers. You can set extra HTTP headers to be sent during the WebSocket handshake. WebSocketHttpHeaders headers; headers[\"foo\"] = \"bar\"; webSocket.setExtraHeaders(headers); Subprotocols You can specify subprotocols to be set during the WebSocket handshake. For more info you can refer to this doc . webSocket.addSubprotocol(\"appProtocol-v1\"); webSocket.addSubprotocol(\"appProtocol-v2\"); The protocol that the server did accept is available in the open info protocol field. std::cout << \"protocol: \" << msg->openInfo.protocol << std::endl; Automatic reconnection Automatic reconnection kicks in when the connection is disconnected without the user consent.

If you are using OpenSSL, try to be on a version higher than 1.1.x as there there are thread safety problems with 1.0.x. Then, secure sockets are automatically used when connecting to a wss://* url. Additional TLS options can be configured by passing a ix::SocketTLSOptions instance to the setTLSOptions on ix::WebSocket (or ix::WebSocketServer or ix::HttpServer ) webSocket.setTLSOptions({ .certFile = \"path/to/cert/file.pem\", .keyFile = \"path/to/key/file.pem\", .caFile = \"path/to/trust/bundle/file.pem\", // as a file, or in memory buffer in PEM format .tls = true // required in server mode }); Specifying certFile and keyFile configures the certificate that will be used to communicate with TLS peers. On a client, this is only necessary for connecting to servers that require a client certificate. On a server, this is necessary for TLS support. Specifying caFile configures the trusted roots bundle file (in PEM format) that will be used to verify peer certificates. - The special value of SYSTEM (the default) indicates that the system-configured trust bundle should be used; this is generally what you want when connecting to any publicly exposed API/server. - The special value of NONE can be used to disable peer verification; this is only recommended to rule out certificate verification when testing connectivity. - If the value contain the special value -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- , the value will be read from memory, and not from a file. This is convenient on platforms like Android where reading / writing to the file system can be challenging without proper permissions, or without knowing the location of a temp directory. For a client, specifying caFile can be used if connecting to a server that uses a self-signed cert, or when using a custom CA in an internal environment. For a server, specifying caFile implies that: 1. You require clients to present a certificate 1. It must be signed by one of the trusted roots in the file","title":"Examples"},{"location":"usage/#examples","text":"The ws folder countains many interactive programs for chat, file transfers , curl like http clients, demonstrating client and server usage.","title":"Examples"},{"location":"usage/#windows-note","text":"To use the network system on Windows, you need to initialize it once with WSAStartup() and clean it up with WSACleanup() .

If you are using OpenSSL, try to be on a version higher than 1.1.x as there there are thread safety problems with 1.0.x. Then, secure sockets are automatically used when connecting to a wss://* url. Additional TLS options can be configured by passing a ix::SocketTLSOptions instance to the setTLSOptions on ix::WebSocket (or ix::WebSocketServer or ix::HttpServer ) webSocket.setTLSOptions({ .certFile = \"path/to/cert/file.pem\", .keyFile = \"path/to/key/file.pem\", .caFile = \"path/to/trust/bundle/file.pem\", // as a file, or in memory buffer in PEM format .tls = true // required in server mode }); Specifying certFile and keyFile configures the certificate that will be used to communicate with TLS peers. On a client, this is only necessary for connecting to servers that require a client certificate. On a server, this is necessary for TLS support. Specifying caFile configures the trusted roots bundle file (in PEM format) that will be used to verify peer certificates. - The special value of SYSTEM (the default) indicates that the system-configured trust bundle should be used; this is generally what you want when connecting to any publicly exposed API/server. - The special value of NONE can be used to disable peer verification; this is only recommended to rule out certificate verification when testing connectivity. - If the value contain the special value -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- , the value will be read from memory, and not from a file. This is convenient on platforms like Android where reading / writing to the file system can be challenging without proper permissions, or without knowing the location of a temp directory. For a client, specifying caFile can be used if connecting to a server that uses a self-signed cert, or when using a custom CA in an internal environment. For a server, specifying caFile implies that: 1. You require clients to present a certificate 1. It must be signed by one of the trusted roots in the file","title":"TLS support and configuration"},{"location":"ws/","text":"General ws is a command line tool that should exercise most of the IXWebSocket code, and provide example code. ws is a websocket tool Usage: ws [OPTIONS] SUBCOMMAND Options: -h,--help Print this help message and exit Subcommands: send Send a file receive Receive a file transfer Broadcasting server connect Connect to a remote server chat Group chat echo_server Echo server broadcast_server Broadcasting server ping Ping pong curl HTTP Client httpd HTTP server curl The curl subcommand try to be compatible with the curl syntax, to fetch http pages.
